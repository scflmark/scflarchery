-- SUMMARY / DESCRIPTION --

The Views module allows you to fetch content from the database and present it
to the user as lists, posts, maps, graphs, galleries, tables, menu items, 
blocks, reports, forum posts etc. Views provides a graphical interface to an
SQL query builder that can access virtually any information in your database,
and then display it in any format. 

You can also use Views to present related content. For example, you can display
a list of users along with links to the content they have created.
